		<h1>Facts</h1>
		<p>The word duke comes from latin dux (leader)
    </p>
		<p>the first duke was chosen in 1337</p>
		<p>the first marquess was chosen in 1385</p>
        <p>The feudal system in medieval Europe was a hierarchical structure with the king at the top, followed by barons, lords, and peasants.</p>
        <p> Peasants made up around 90% of the population and had a hard life, often working long days and barely having enough food to survive.</p>
        <p>The king believed in the "divine right" to rule, and the Catholic Church was very powerful, with bishops managing areas called dioceses and receiving a tithe of 10% from all the people. </p>
        <p>The lords and barons ruled large areas of land called fiefs and were responsible for maintaining an army at the king's service.</p>
        <p>The local lord ran the manor, which was the center of life in the Middle Ages, and peasants worked the land in exchange for protection.</p>
        <p>Land was granted to people in exchange for service, creating a system of loyalty and obligation.</p>
        <p>When a king died, his firstborn son would inherit the throne, and a long-lasting family rule was called a dynasty.</p>
